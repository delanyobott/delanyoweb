        <h4>Fronted Design &amp; Consulting</h4>
        <p>
          I love making cool things on the web. I write HTML, CSS and

          online presence in the areas of Digital Marketing, Social Media
          Management, Content Writing &amp; Site Administration, Search Engine
          Optimization and Google Map Integration. If you have an idea of a
          website or a project that can use my fronted skill, please feel free

        <h4>Thoughtful Quotes</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <q>
              The journey begins by letting go off control, and becoming
              flexible.
            </q>
            <cite> &mdash; Gary Keller</cite>
          </p>
          <p>
            <q>
              Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!
            </q>
            <cite>&mdash; Ms Frizzle</cite>
          </p>
          <p>
            <q>
              It is not where you are coming from, neither where you are going.
              It is the understanding of the methodologies of the system that
              matters more.
