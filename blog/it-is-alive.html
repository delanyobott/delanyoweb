          <h2>Launching my website (It's all fun!)</h2>

          <p>
            In February 2018, I was just few months into my journey of learning
            web development. It was a big task for me to learn not only the
            fundamental skills required, but also keeping track with the
            fast-moving industry. Just I was getting to the level where it felt
            as though I could build a simple website, I started to realize, it
            was only the beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I did it! And the best part is it wasn't as scary or difficult
            as it first felt. I've to admit how enjoyable it was when am finally
            able to do this stuff. And I've to thank
            <a href="https://francishammondghana.com">Francis Hammond</a>, for
            his inspiration. He actually did it first. Then I follow up.
          </p>
          <h3>how I built this site</h3>
          <p>
            When I first started learning web development, properly, I did a few
            courses on HTML for structure, CSS for styling (my favorite), and
            JavaScript for interaction, which at the crux of it is all you need
            to get a website on the internet, and you don't even need JavaScript
            as such.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="../images/css.jpg" alt="" />
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to really immerse myself in this new world (Hello World!)
            of fronted development, and to do that I decided to research modern
            and standard techniques for web development.
          </p>
          <p>And just like that, It was a misery.</p>
          <p>
            Angular, Vue, React, GraphQL, Web Components, WordPress (heck
            fucked!), Laravel, Django, Atomic Design. Styled Components,
            Bootstrap, Sass, Less, Severless, Cloud Functions, Git, Github, Oh
            dear Lord.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last one isn't a framework, or a library, or an architecture, or
            an API, or whatever. It's overwhelming feeling that came over me.
            There's so damn much going on in web (or software) development. It's
            awesome and terrifying.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did a lot of research, read books, articles from awesome
            <a href="https://heydonworks.com/">people</a> in the
            <a href="https://smashingmagazine.com">community</a>, and
            <a href="https://css-tricks.com">tricks</a> that I have grown to
            <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk">respect</a>,
            <a href="https://keithjgrant.com/">admire</a>, and
            <a href="https://adamsilver.io">subscribed</a>, and
            <a href="https://filamentgroup.com">follow</a>, and that led me to
            settle on CSS, HTML and presentational JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main technologies I used for this site were HTML, CSS, vanilla
            JavaScript, Netlify and NetlifyCMS. The choice to go these means I
            get super fast, resilient and accessible website, which include
            responsive images, great value hosting and open source content
            management system. Because I want my site to be standard and simple,
            I used more of HTML, of CSS, and less of JavaScript in the design
            process. This is actually called, progressive enhancement.
          </p>
          <h3>Anatomy</h3>
          <p>
            For now, the site consists of a few pages. There is this top
            navigation and a drop down menu. The
            <a href="/index.html">home page</a> introduces everything within the
            site. I wanted to create quality things, especially on the web, so I
            presented the myself more in the
            <a href="/about.html">about me page</a>, this is nothing more than a
            profession. The <a href="/gallery.html">gallery page</a> was
            designed to learn more about image manipulation, but it was fun. I
            <a href="/references.html">referenced</a> some links, books, videos
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4K5CZRpPyHafY5cDBtV07Q"
              >(YouTube)</a
            >
            and audios
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-212817371">(Soundcloud)</a>,
            also for learning and fun!
          </p>
          <h3>Just as, I begin</h3>
          <p>
            I decide to continuing my journey into the world of fronted
            development. I love doing things, learning and seeing my
            jorgorlorjorgorlor (combination of scary and awkward) code and
            algorithm compiled, or transpiled, or interpreted into some jazzy
            colours and fonts, and layouts, and interactions, is a wonderful
            feeling. There's always more to learn, and that really ginger me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <q>
              A minute to learn, a lifetime to master.
            </q>
          </p>
          <p>
            <q>
              And it's always good and glorious to bounce in, to explore, to
              tinker out of, this world.
            </q>
          </p>
          <p>
            SO BOUNCE! AND MAKE MISTAKES! AND TINKER OUT! AND EXPLORE FOR MORE!
          </p>
