          Launching my website (It's all fun!)
          <small class="date">15th August 2019</small>
        </h2>

        <p>
          In February 2018, I was just few months into my journey of learning
          web development. It was a big task for me to learn not only the
          fundamental skills required, but also keeping track with the
          fast-moving industry. Just I was getting to the level where it felt as
          though I could build a simple website, I started to realize, it was
          only the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I did it! And the best part is it wasn't as scary or difficult as
          it first felt. I've to admit how enjoyable it was when am finally able
          to do this stuff. And I've to thank
          <a href="https://francishammondghana.com">Francis Hammond</a>, for his
          inspiration. He actually did it first. Then I follow up.
        </p>
        <h3>how I built this site</h3>
        <p>
          When I first started learning web development, properly, I did a few
          courses on HTML for structure, CSS for styling (my favorite), and
          JavaScript for interaction, which at the crux of it is all you need to
          get a website on the internet, and you don't even need JavaScript as
          such.
        </p>
        <p class="image">
          <img src="../../images/css.jpg" alt="CSS" />
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to really immerse myself in this new world (Hello World!) of
          fronted development, and to do that I decided to research modern and
          standard techniques for web development.
        </p>
        <p>And just like that, It was a misery.</p>
        <p>
          Angular, Vue, React, GraphQL, Web Components, WordPress (heck
          fucked!), Laravel, Django, Atomic Design. Styled Components,
          Bootstrap, Sass, Less, Severless, Cloud Functions, Git, Github, Oh
          dear Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last one isn't a framework, or a library, or an architecture, or
          an API, or whatever. It's overwhelming feeling that came over me.
          There's so damn much going on in web (or software) development. It's
          awesome and terrifying.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did a lot of research, read books, articles from awesome
          <a href="https://heydonworks.com/">people</a> in the
          <a href="https://smashingmagazine.com">community</a>, and
          <a href="https://css-tricks.com">tricks</a> that I have grown to
          <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk">respect</a>,
          <a href="https://keithjgrant.com/">admire</a>, and
          <a href="https://adamsilver.io">subscribed</a>, and
          <a href="https://filamentgroup.com">follow</a>, and that led me to
          settle on CSS, HTML and presentational JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main technologies I used for this site were HTML, CSS, vanilla
          JavaScript, Netlify and NetlifyCMS. The choice to go these means I get
          super fast, resilient and accessible website, which include responsive
          images, great value hosting and open source content management system.
          Because I want my site to be standard and simple, I used more of HTML,
          of CSS, and less of JavaScript in the design process. This is actually
          called, progressive enhancement.
        </p>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>
          For now, the site consists of a few pages. The
          <a href="/index.html">home page</a> introduces everything within the
          site. I wanted to create quality things, especially on the web, so I
          presented the myself more in the
          <a href="/about.html">about me page</a>. I
          <a href="/references.html">referenced</a> some links, books, videos
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4K5CZRpPyHafY5cDBtV07Q"
            >(YouTube)</a
          >
          and audios
          <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-212817371">(Soundcloud)</a>, just
          for learning and fun!
        </p>

        <h3>Just as, I begin</h3>
        <p>
          I decide to continuing my journey into the world of fronted
          development. I love doing things, learning and seeing my
          jorgorlorjorgorlor (mixture of scary and awkward) code and algorithm
          compiled, or transpiled, or interpreted into some jazzy colours and
          fonts, and layouts, and interactions, is a wonderful feeling. There's
          always more to learn, and that really excites me.
        </p>
        <p>
          <q>
            A minute to learn, a lifetime to master.
          </q>
        </p>
        <p>
          <q>
            And it's always good and glorious to bounce in, to explore, to
            tinker out of, this world.
          </q>
        </p>
        <p>
          SO BOUNCE! AND MAKE MISTAKES! AND TINKER OUT! AND EXPLORE FOR MORE!
