        <h4>About delanyo agbenyo</h4>
        <p>
          I'm a fronted developer who loves solving problems with inclusive

        <h4>My Role</h4>
        <p>
          My skills range from fronted design. I design simple interactions for
          digital services by using existing or creating new styles, components
          and patterns. I help discover user needs and transform them into
          solutions to meet those needs. I do that by challenging assumptions
          and prototyping ideas for testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm well concerned with the way things function as the way they look.
          My work covers user journeys and navigation as well as micro
          interactions. I make beautiful and working web software. I'm satisfied
          when my work is in the hands of users, delivering values.
