        <h4>About Delanyo Agbenyo</h4>
        <p>
          I'm an interaction designer who loves solving problems with inclusive
          design, interface design, and design systems. I love making cool
          things on the web.

        <h4>My Role</h4>
        <p>
          My skills range from fronted and backend development to operations. I
          design simple interactions for digital services by using exiting or
          creating new styles, components and patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          I help discover user needs and transform them into solutions to meet
          those needs. I do that by challenging assumptions and prototyping
          ideas for testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm well concerned with the way things function as the way they look.
          My work covers user journeys and navigation as well as micro
          interactions. I make beautiful and working web software. I'm satisfied
          when my work is in the hands of users, delivering values.

        <h4>Personal Life</h4>
        <p>
          In my personal life, I'm from Ve, a suburb of Hohoe, Ghana. In 2018, I
          graduated from St. Francis College of Education.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am doing this web development stuff for a while now, because I
          desperately need new skills for prototyping startups. After several
          months of learning designs and development, I found myself a freelance
          work. So, am real happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, am using my expertise, skills and knowledge
          <a href="/projects.html">creating cool things</a>, and
          <a href="https://t.me/owl_web">helping others</a>
          who wanna dive into the Hello World!
