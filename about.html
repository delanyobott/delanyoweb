            <p>
              I'm an interaction designer who loves solving problems with
              inclusive design, interface design, and design systems. I love
              making cool things on the web.

            <h4>my role</h4>
            <p>
              My skills range from fronted and backend development to
              operations. I design simple interactions for digital services by
              using exiting or creating new styles, components and patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
              I help discover user needs and transform them into solutions to
              meet those needs. I do that by challenging assumptions and
              prototyping ideas for testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm more concerned with the way things function as the way they
              look. My work covers user journeys and navigation as well as micro
              interactions. I make working and beautiful web software. I'm
              satisfied when my craft is in the hands of users, delivering
              values.

            <h4>personal life</h4>
            <p>
              In my personal life, I'm from Ve, a suburb of Hohoe, Ghana. In
              2018, I graduated from St. Francis College of Education.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am doing this web development stuff for a while now, because I
              desperately need new skills for prototyping startups. After
              several months of learning design and development, I found myself
              a freelance work. So, am real happy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, am using my expertise, skills and knowledge
              <a href="/projects.html">creating cool things</a>, and
              <a href="https://t.me/owl_web">helping others</a>
              who wanna dive into the Hello World!
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly,, am not a fun of few things. I believe in personal
              development,,, not a fun of political promises. I believe and
              practice spirituality,,, not a fun of religion. I believe in
              capitalism,,, not a fun of laziness. I believe in fastlane,, not a
              fun of shortcuts (the work has to be DONE, but very fast and
              smarty). I believe and hope for
              <a href="https://thinkbigforafrica.com">Africa</a>,, and I work
              towards the future!
